# 📊 Demographic Visualization in R – Treemap Analysis & ggplot2

This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 1**, a group project that combines theoretical understanding of visualizations (treemaps) with practical use of **R**, **ggplot2**, and **Quarto** to analyze Swedish population data.

## 🧠 Treemap Analysis (Task 1)

A theoretical reflection task where you:

- Analyze what the treemap communicates
- Explain how **size**, **color**, and **shade** are used for encoding
- Reflect on how **3D effects** may distort interpretation
- Discuss the **advantages and limitations** of treemaps
- Suggest improvements for more effective design

## 📈 Demographic Analysis with ggplot2 (Task 2–3)

### 📊 Task 2 – Population Pyramid with ggplot2 (1923 vs 2023)

- Dataset: `population_1923_2023.csv`
- Use `ggplot2` to create **mirrored bar charts** for age and gender distribution
- Compare two years (1923 and 2023) side-by-side

### 📉 Task 3 – Age Distribution Over Time (1860–2023)

- Dataset: `population_1860_2023.csv`
- Visualize **historical changes in age structure**
- Choose your own effective visualization technique (line plots, area plots, facets, etc.)

💡 *Note: Early historical data may include inconsistencies.*

## 💬 Summary

This project merges **visualization theory** with **hands-on R programming**, applying best practices for communicating demographic trends through clearly structured charts and written analysis. It builds practical and conceptual competence in data visualization.
